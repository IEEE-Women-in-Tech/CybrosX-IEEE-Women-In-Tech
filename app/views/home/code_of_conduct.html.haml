      %h3 Reporting

      %p
        If you are being harassed by a member of OS4W.org, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the OS4W staff at admin@os4w.org. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

      %p
        This code of conduct applies to OS4W.org spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of OS4W.org outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by OS4W.org members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from OS4W.org based on their past behavior, including behavior outside OS4W.org spaces and behavior towards people who are not in OS4W.org.

      %p
        In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

      %p
        We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of OS4W.org members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

      %h3 Consequences

      %p
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

      %p
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, OS4W staff may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all OS4W.org spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other OS4W.org members or the general public.
