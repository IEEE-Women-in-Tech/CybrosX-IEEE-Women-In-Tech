CybrosX -IEEE Women In Tech
======================

A resource for connecting women and non-binary people in technology with friendly
and welcoming open source projects.

## To install and run the application locally

### Pre-requisites

- Postgres (OSX users can run `brew install postgresql`)
- bundler (`gem install bundler`)
- Ruby 2.2.1

### Environment variables

Create a .env file in the root folder, and add the following keys. For development purposes,
the values don't really matter.

    ADMIN_EMAIL=foo
    MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID=foo
    MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=foo
    SENDGRID_USERNAME=foo
    SENDGRID_PASSWORD=foo
    GITHUB_USER=foo
    GITHUB_TOKEN=foo

### Installation

- `bundle install`
- (start your Postgres db)
- `rake db:create` (TODO: create seed data)
- (remember to migrate which in a Rails 4 app is `rake db:migrate`)

To create an initial admin user, fire up `rails c` and do the following:

    u = User.create(username: "Whatever", password: "foo123456", email: "me@domain.org", password_confirmation: "foo123456")
    u.activate!
    u.is_admin = true
    u.save

### Running the server

- `rails s`
